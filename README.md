Journal 8-1 Portfolio
    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
      The problem we were trying to solve was storing and displaying course information for the client ABCU. 
      This course dealt with Binary Trees, HashTables, and linked lists as well as cover arrays and vectors and how they all differ from 
      one another, also the appropriate time to incorporate them in software development.
      
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
      In the course I was able to follow along the layed out instructions to help write the code I need to write 
      once I figured out how to effectively write it out and get the function to act the way it was supposed to
      I spent more time analyzing afterwards how the data structures differed from one another, rather than during I spend more time just 
      going through Zybooks and youtube on how to implement these data structures in code. 
      
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
      One of the biggest roadblocks I encountered was recursive I actually youtubed it mostly and that seemed to help me grasp the concept.
      
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
      Well for this project for starters to me it is a great new method to me to being able to handle data and use code to build these data structures 
      to easily access the required informations. When I took my Data class and dealt with SQL this just seemed like the other side of it to being able to 
      develop those softwares designed to store, retrieve, add, and delete data.
      
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
       I think all of these elements come from practice. I have written enough file streams that I now have a common function 
       that I use as a prototype. I might even take a few of some other elements I keep reusing and develop them in to libraries.
